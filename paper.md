# Abstract

This study aims to design and implement a laughter recognition software system based on multimodal fusion and deep learning, leveraging image and audio processing technologies to achieve accurate laughter recognition and emotion analysis. First, the system loads video files and uses the OpenCV library to extract facial information while employing the Librosa library to process audio features such as MFCC. Then, multimodal fusion techniques are used to integrate image and audio features, followed by training and prediction using deep learning models. Evaluation results indicate that the model achieved 80% accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset, with an F1 score of 80%, demonstrating robust performance and the ability to handle real-world data variability. This study not only verifies the effectiveness of multimodal fusion methods in laughter recognition but also highlights their potential applications in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Future work will focus on further optimizing feature extraction and model architecture to improve recognition accuracy and expand application scenarios, promoting the development of laughter recognition technology in fields such as mental health monitoring and educational activity evaluation.

# Introduction

Laughter plays a crucial role in human emotional communication, promoting social connections, reducing stress, and improving mental health. Numerous studies have shown that laughter not only positively impacts individual mental health but also plays a significant role in social interactions. Recognizing laughter in educational activities can facilitate various educational activities, such as organizing seminars and team projects to promote interaction and communication among students (Elias & Arnold, 2006). Despite the significant applications of laughter recognition in affective computing and human-computer interaction, existing methods face numerous challenges in terms of dataset quality, feature extraction, diversity, and complexity. Multimodal fusion methods that combine audio and facial expression features are expected to improve the effectiveness of laughter recognition.

# Software Implementation Steps

To realize the aforementioned technical solutions, we designed a series of detailed implementation steps covering the entire process from data preparation, image and audio processing, to feature extraction, model design, and training. The specific implementation steps are as follows:

1. **Load Video Files and Extract Image Features**: First, load video files using the `loadVideo` method and extract image features using the OpenCV library. This involves using OpenCV's `VideoCapture` class to load video files, iterating through video frames, and converting them to grayscale images for subsequent smile detection and feature extraction.

2. **Extract Audio Features**: Extract audio features from the video files using the `extractAudioFeatures` method. This method employs the TarsosDSP library to extract audio features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and stores the extracted audio features for further analysis.

3. **Extract Emotional Features of Laughter**: Utilize the librosa library for audio processing, including MFCC feature extraction and spectrum analysis. The `librosa.feature.mfcc` function is used to compute the MFCC features of the audio. Laughter feature extraction is based on the frequency range, energy distribution, and temporal characteristics of the laughter.

4. **Detect Smiles**: Detect smiles using the `detectSmile` method with OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier, marking the smile regions on the images.

5. **Recognize Laughter**: Recognize laughter in the video files by integrating the aforementioned methods through the `detectLaugh` method.

6. **Model Design and Training**: Design and train the laughter recognition model using the `designModel` and `trainAndOptimizeModel` methods. Select appropriate machine learning or deep learning models and train and optimize them using the extracted image and audio features.

# Model Evaluation Results

This section details the evaluation results of the laughter recognition model. To validate the model's effectiveness and robustness, we employed multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix. Additionally, we analyzed the model architecture and parameters to ensure the robustness and generalization capability of its performance.

On the test dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 80%, indicating a high level of correctness in recognizing laughter. The precision was 80%, meaning that 80% of the instances predicted as laughter were indeed true laughter. The recall (sensitivity) was also 80%, indicating that 80% of the actual laughter instances were correctly identified by the model. The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was also 80%, demonstrating a balance between accuracy and completeness.

The confusion matrix provides detailed results of the model's performance in classifying laughter and non-laughter instances. Out of 15 test samples, the model correctly identified 12 laughter instances (true positives) and misclassified 3 non-laughter instances as laughter (false positives). The model's performance in predicting the label as 1 (i.e., laughter) was lacking, as reflected by the false negative count of 0, leading to a recall of 0 in the test data.

The model architecture includes multiple convolutional neural network layers and fully connected layers, with a total parameter count of 174,728 and trainable parameters amounting to 58,242. During training, the model's performance progressively improved, with the training accuracy increasing from an initial 60.53% to 69.25%. This indicates that the model adapted to the data over the training process and improved its classification performance.

In summary, the model demonstrated a trend of gradual improvement during training and ultimately achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. Despite underperformance in certain instances, the model overall exhibited robustness and the ability to handle variations in real-world data. Future work will focus on optimizing feature extraction and model architecture to further enhance the precision and recall of laughter recognition. The high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score validate the model's potential application in laughter recognition and emotion analysis, providing users with accurate and reliable analysis results.

# Conclusion

The results indicate that the multimodal fusion approach comprehensively captures laughter features, reducing errors associated with a single modality and thereby improving recognition performance.

Firstly, in data preparation, we successfully connected to the database and extracted a substantial amount of MP4 video and WAV audio data, providing a solid foundation for model training. Subsequently, using the OpenCV library for image processing, we accurately located and extracted smile information from the videos. Additionally, the audio processing module utilized the librosa library, particularly MFCC features, to support laughter emotion analysis.

In the laughter recognition module, we fused image and audio features and employed deep learning techniques to achieve accurate laughter classification. Model evaluation results show that the final model achieved 80% accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset, with an F1 score of 80%, demonstrating a good balance between accuracy and completeness.

Although the model underperformed in certain instances, it generally exhibited robustness and the ability to handle variations in real-world data. Further optimization of feature extraction algorithms and model architecture is expected to enhance the model's precision and recall.

This study not only achieved significant breakthroughs in laughter recognition technology but also laid a foundation for future development and application. Future work will focus on optimizing feature extraction and model architecture to improve recognition accuracy and expand application scenarios. Additionally, this study emphasizes the importance of integrating multimodal fusion methods to enhance the effectiveness of laughter recognition. The laughter recognition technology developed in this study has potential applications in fields such as mental health monitoring, educational activity evaluation, and human-computer interaction, offering new opportunities for emotion analysis and interaction technology development.
