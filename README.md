# SmileRecognition
SmileRecognition is a Python-based software designed to extract smile features (video frames, smile locations, smile rates) and laughter features (frequency range, energy distribution, time domain features) from videos. Utilizing convolutional neural networks, this tool detects and recognizes smiling faces and laughter, aiding research in psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and emotion analysis.

## Features
- **Smile Detection**: Detects and analyzes smiles in video frames.
- **Laughter Analysis**: Extracts laughter features from audio files.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced convolutional neural networks.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides smile rates and detailed laughter features.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source project under the MIT license.

## Functions
- Development Principles and Design Philosophy
The software divides smiles into two dimensions: laughter and smiling faces, and extracts features using deep learning technology to establish a deep fusion convolutional neural network.

    - Deepfusion_network_model.py: Model establishment, training, and evaluation.
    - Smile Recognitionï¼šUtilizes pre-existing deep learning discriminators in OpenCV to identify facial grayscale values.Features include facial features and Smile Ratio (angle of mouth corner uplift).

- Laughter Recognition
  - Main features include Main Frequencies, Energy Distribution, and Time Domain Features, extracted using the librosa library.
  - Deep Fusion Network Model
  - DConsists of three steps:
      - Feature extraction and preprocessing.
      - Model architecture: Utilizes Conv1D and LSTM layers to extract audio and facial features, followed by GlobalMaxPooling1D for global features.           Features are concatenated and passed through fully connected layers for classification.
      - Training and evaluation: Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer, adds Recall and Precision evaluation metrics. Trains the model on the training set and evaluates it on the test set, outputting classification reports and confusion matrices.

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Downloading Data**
  If your software requires specific datasets, provide instructions on how to download them. For example:
  Download the Sample Video Data
  You can download the sample video data from this link. After downloading, unzip the files into a directory named data.

sh
Copy code
mkdir data
unzip sample-videos.zip -d data
